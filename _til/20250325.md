# In yaml you can use special indicators like `>` or `|` to handle multiline strings

`|` means "literal block scalar", which produces a multiline string with no special formatting

```yaml
run:
  command: |
    npm run dev
    npm run test
```

translates to:

`npm run dev\nnpm run test`

The cool one I learned about today is `>-`, which is a "folded block scalar". It preserves line breaks as spaces (folding them into a single line). The `-` modifier tells YAML to "chomp" (remove) any trailing newlines at the end of the block

### Example YAML
```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    options: >-
      --health-cmd pg_isready
      --health-interval 10s
      --health-timeout 5s
      --health-retries 5
```

translates to

```shell
... --health-cmd pg_isready --health-interval 10s --health-timeout 5s --health-retries 5
```
