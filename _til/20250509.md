Did you know that you can use [`closest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/closest) to find an element's nearest ancestor (including the element itself, which it checks first) that matches a specific selector? I didn't! 

```js
const btn = document.querySelector("#content").closest("button");
```

How useful is that?!
