Today I learned about the cool native html elements via this [post](https://harrisonbroadbent.com/blog/cool-native-html-elements/)

It also let me to discover [the IndieWeb Ring project](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Webring)

Connecting to the ring is super easy with [indielogin](https://indielogin.com/)

Here are the steps it takes to connect via Github (there are other ways as well):

1. In your github profile settings

- Add your blog URL in the website field
- Make sure it matches exactly, including thr `https://`

2. Add the following link tags to the head of your html

```html
<link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="https://indieauth.com/auth" />
<link rel="token_endpoint" href="https://indieauth.com/token" />
```

2. Add a link back to your blog

```html
2. [connect to the ring](https://indielogin.com/connect#github)
```
